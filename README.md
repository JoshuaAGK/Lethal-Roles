This is a script with a simple CLI for rotating a set of roles in Lethal Company for a set of players.

The roles are distributed to avoid repetition for the players, by eliminating adjacent duplicates, and evenly positioning the roles throughout the array.

There's a set of commands for distributing roles to users, adding new users & roles, or removing users.

Press enter to display the roles for the next day.

I might make a GUI for this someday. Probably not. Who knows?
